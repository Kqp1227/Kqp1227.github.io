HI! My name is Qingpeng Kong (孔庆芃 in Chinese, pronounced as Kǒng Qìng Péng or Kaw-ng Ching Puh-ng), and you can also call me Erica.🥰 I'm a first-year master student at the Suzhou Institute for Advanced Research, University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), co-supervised by [Prof. S. Kevin Zhou](https://sz.ustc.edu.cn/en/en_research_show/42.html) and [Dr. Zihang Jiang](https://zihangjiang.github.io/). Previously, I served as a visiting intern at the [Sustainable Computing Laboratory (SCL)](https://www3.nd.edu/~scl/index.html) located at the University of Notre Dame, supervised by [Prof. Yiyu Shi](https://engineering.nd.edu/faculty/yiyu-shi/). I also closely worked with [Dr. Po-Chih Kuo](https://sites.google.com/site/bfantasykuo/) at NTHU, and [Dr. Xiaowei Xu](https://xiaoweixu.github.io/) at Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital.

My research primarily focuses on AI4Med, AI fairness, and computer vision. If you are interested in my work or want to collaborate, feel free to contact me via email: qpkong27 [at] gmail [dot] com. 🥳
