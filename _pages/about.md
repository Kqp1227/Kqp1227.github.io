HI! My name is Qingpeng Kong (孔庆芃 in Chinese, pronounced as Kǒng Qìng Péng or Kaw-ng Ching Puh-ng), and you can also call me Erica.🥰 I'm a  master student at UC Berkeley and currently a visiting researcher at MIT, advised by [Prof. Leo Anthony Celi](https://imes.mit.edu/people/celi-leo). Previously, I conducted graduate research at University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), co-supervised by [Prof. S. Kevin Zhou](https://sz.ustc.edu.cn/en/en_research_show/42.html) and [Dr. Zihang Jiang](https://zihangjiang.github.io/). I also served as a visiting intern at the University of Notre Dame, supervised by [Prof. Yiyu Shi](https://engineering.nd.edu/faculty/yiyu-shi/), and closely worked with [Prof. Po-Chih Kuo](https://sites.google.com/site/bfantasykuo/) at NTHU, and [Prof. Xiaowei Xu](https://xiaoweixu.github.io/) at Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital.

My research primarily focuses on AI4Med, AI fairness, and computer vision. If you are interested in my work or want to collaborate, feel free to contact me via email: qpkong27 [at] gmail [dot] com. 🥳
