HI! My name is Qingpeng Kong (Â≠îÂ∫ÜËäÉ in Chinese, pronounced as K«íng Q√¨ng P√©ng or Kaw-ng Ching Puh-ng), and you can also call me Erica. I'm a senior undergraduate student at Northeastern University, China. I am currently serving as a visiting intern at the [Sustainable Computing Laboratory (SCL)](https://www3.nd.edu/~scl/index.html) located at the University of Notre Dame, supervised by [Prof. Yiyu Shi](https://engineering.nd.edu/faculty/yiyu-shi/). I'm about to join the [MIRACLE Laboratory](https://miracle.ustc.edu.cn/2022/1121/c32999a585823/page.htm) at the University of Science and Technology of China, co-supervised by [Prof. S. Kevin Zhou](https://sz.ustc.edu.cn/en/en_research_show/42.html) and [Dr. Zihang Jiang](https://zihangjiang.github.io/). Previously, I closely worked with [Dr. Xiaomeng Li](https://xmengli.github.io/) at HKUST, [Dr. Xiaowei Xu](https://xiaoweixu.github.io/) at Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital, [Dr. Wenfeng Song](https://buaaswf.github.io/songwenfeng/) at Beijing Information Science and Technology University, and [Prof. Tao Ren](http://faculty.neu.edu.cn/rent/en/zhym/63153/list/index.htm) at Northeastern University.
